## Motivation 
I was always been an enthusiastic gamer and my Steam library is very rich in terms of games, so it is a good place to collect data.

## Data Source 
- Data gathered from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> directly.
- Data is scrapped using  [Steam Store project](https://github.com/nik-davis/steam-data-science-project)   

## Data Analysis
The analysis was done by categorizing games by type and number of hours played. In addition, we also looked at games by month and percentage of play.


## Findings
I found out i mostly spent time on playing genres Souls-like, Action-Adventure, Roguelike, Cyberpunk. Which some of them are my generel life interests. I also found that i played less games this year than last year.

## Limitations and Future Work
I don't have access to the data of which game I played on which day and how much I played. That was a limitation for me.  It prevented me from doing a more detailed data analysis. 
In the future, it would be great for research if it could record how much time was spent on which game at what time and date, or if this feature could be activated via Steam.
